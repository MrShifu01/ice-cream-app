- Create an HTML file called index.html. You may need to create other
webpages, but this will be your homepage that acts as the landing page
for your website.
---
-  Create at least 2 other pages (this could include pages such as “about me”,
“contact details”, etc., or even different categories of your hobby, e.g.
“starters”, “main courses” and “desserts” if you’re show-casing recipes).
---
-  Within the entirety of your site, you should have the following elements:
- -  At least 5 images.
- -  At least 3 font sizes (to help differentiate sections).
- -  At least 2 external links (maybe to another website, or an email
address).
- -  At least 1 table.
- -  At least 1 list (ordered or unordered, you can choose).
- -  At least one submit button form (possibly to subscribe to a
newsletter — don’t worry about the functionality of this yet).
- -  At least one radio button form (e.g. you could ask a future
subscriber what types of recipes they’d like to receive).
- -  At least one quote/testimonial
- -  At least 2 blocks (i.e text with a background).
---

- Create a functional “Save for later” page for your website, where users
can earmark articles, images, recipes, etc. in a personal folder to be
able to go back and see them later.
---

-  Each item/recipe/image, etc. must have the option to “Save for later”.
---

-  When an item is added, an alert should tell the user how many items
are in their “Save for later” folder.
---

-  Create a new HTML page for the “Save for later” section, which allows
the user to see what is in their folder.
